            <p>Many blockchains mention that their consensus mechanisms are sustainable and are not as wasteful in terms of energy consumption as the more popular blockchains, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, as they have pivoted to consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake and Proof of Space. These blockchains apply labels such as "carbon neutral" and "carbon negative," but these claims cannot be independently verified easily. </p>
                
            <p>As part of this project, we will evaluate various smart contracts to assess how the carbon credits are paid, the historical ledger of the respective blockchains, and the overall network computation to ascertain the blockchains' carbon expenditures, as well as other publicly published reputable sources on how much renewable energy these blockchains are leveraging. Combining the data from all these data sources, we will create a verifiable proof for carbon labels associated with blockchain, and easy-to-understand visualizations.</p>
